In this repositry, I made a machine learning program to judge whether an employee could quit a company or not.
This program was made to pass the graduation exam of AI job college (Tokyo).

The header information is left or not (Correct answer label), satisfaction_level, last_evaluation, number_project, 
average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, Work_accident, promotion_last_5years, sales and salary.
Based on these information, this program judge.

In this program, I used "scikit-learn".
This is an open source to use machine learning. Using this open source, you can construct a machine learning program easily.
I constructed 5 patterns of machine learning, which are k-nearest neighbor algorithm (knn), logistic regression algorithm (logistic), 
support vector machine (rsvc), gradient boost classifier (gb) and Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (mlp).

Generally, machine learning algorithm is improved by standard scaling. Because of that, a standard scaler was included all pipelines.

To evaluate which algorithm is the best, I derived 3 types of score of accuracy, f1 score and cross validation score.
Based on these scores, you can choose the best model.

This program is still improving.
